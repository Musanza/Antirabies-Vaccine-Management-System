# Antirabies-Vaccine-Management-System
The system provides an effective way of ensuring availability of anti-rabies vaccines in health facilities so as to encourage health workers to effectively delivery health care services to dog bite victims and prevent deaths from rabies. The developed system can be used by all existing health care facilities in Zambia for the management of anti-rabies vaccines.
